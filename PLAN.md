This is a new framework..

So working with revel team and using "develop" in revel..

## Step 1)

Get a structure working, making it modular..
an olde project, but a new backend.. to the prototype..

so this is making it up as we go along..

Immedeate Objectives..
- get up an running a simple static site..
- make the system modular and even now
.. make placeholder files and where maybe stuff should go..



IMMEDEATE PROBLEMS 

- Where do I create my clock..
-- I need a global time on this "server" and return this
- also need to make it fire off events.. on a schedule
- 

- where to create db definition..

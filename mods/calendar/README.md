Calendar Mod
==============================

The calendar mod is the heart and sould of the factory system..

So we need within the shift pattern,
- the factory stop pattern
- the tea break enviroment..

The end clients are 
- a big clock up on the wall with shift pattern

- The welding crew on a factory floor will like this..

- To get the welding floor together,, we need to be able to send alerts
-- eg sandwich van is outside in 5 mins... 
-- There is a cake cutting ceremony in the staff office at 10.20am - 11.50am

All web clients, and pyqt clients et all need to sync with this remote
service as a trusted time of where things are at.
